## Name and Meta Ideology

Kitchen is a place where some products are cooked via some recipes. Duality of the
process is of main concern. Kitchen script language corresponds to the recipe part of duality.
while JavaScript corresponds to the material.

Each Kitchen script (either complete or not) represents some partially accomplished
cooking process. When some ingredients added (generated by another "recipes" or not),
some dish ready for consumption is served.
